# Reading Log: Understanding Deep Learning

This file tracks my progress through the book _Understanding Deep Learning_ (by Simon J.D. Prince, based on the draft ToC).

## 🎯 My Goals

- Build a foundational understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Master the architecture of shallow and deep neural networks.
- Understand the theory and application of modern architectures like CNNs, Residual Networks, Transformers, and GNNs.
- Explore the landscape of generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models).
- Grasp the core concepts of reinforcement learning.
- Reflect on the ethical implications of deep learning.
